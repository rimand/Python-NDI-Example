# PyNDI
 
A Very simple python video reader for NewTek NDI using CFFI (must be added as a dependency) created by [CarlosFdez](https://github.com/CarlosFdez).
Very initial state, only reads video, use at your own risk.

Tested with NewTek NDI 4.5 and Python 3.8.

The NDI runtime must be installed. Recommended NDI tools to be installed too for testing.
